Brian Maicke is an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Penn State Harrisburg, an undergraduate college and graduate school of The Pennsylvania State University. 
He earned his Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Tennessee Space Institute for his research on compressible flow modeling in rocket motors. 
He teaches courses primarily in thermo-fluids and computer aided engineering at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. 
His research interests center on using analytical and computational methods to investigate fluid phenomena in a wide range of fields. 
Most of his current work focuses on aerospace applications, including modeling the internal flow-fields present in solid and liquid rockets, supersonic nozzle phenomena, and particle-flow interactions.
